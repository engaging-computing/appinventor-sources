       <h3>App Inventor Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h3>
       <p><i>University of Massachusetts Lowell</i></p>

       <p>Welcome to UMass Lowell's App Inventor website
        (the "Site").  The Site runs on Google's App Engine service. You must
        read and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
        (collectively, the "Terms") prior to using any portion of this
        Site. These Terms are an agreement between you and the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell).
        If you do not understand or do not agree to
        be bound by these Terms, please immediately exit this Site.</p>

       <p>UMass Lowell reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time and will
        publish notice of any such modifications online on this page for a
        reasonable period of time following such modifications, and by
        changing the effective date of these Terms. By continuing to access
        the Site after notice of such changes have been posted, you signify
        your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure to return to this page
        periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of
        these Terms.</p>

       <h4>Description of App Inventor</h4>

       <p>From this Site you can access a version of App Inventor, which lets you
        develop applications for Android devices using a web browser and
        either a connected phone or emulator. You can also use the Site to
        store your work and keep track of your projects. App Inventor was
        originally developed by Google. The Site also includes documentation
        and educational content, and this is being licensed to you under the
        Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
        license
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
           target="_blank">(CC BY
         4.0).</a></p>

       <h4>Distinction from MIT</h4>
       <p>This Site is operated by the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The Site contains a derivative
        version of App Inventor including features not present in the version operated by MIT.
        This agreement is only valid for the Site operated by University of Massachusetts Lowell, and does not imply
        any agreement with MIT. The name of the software is "MIT App Inventor" which can be seen throughout the Site,
        and the presence of this name does not imply any agreement with MIT.</p>

       <h4>Account Required for Use of App Inventor</h4>

       <p>In order to log in to App Inventor, you need to use a Google
        account. Your use of that account is subject to Google's Terms of
        Service for accounts, and the information you provide to
        Google is governed by Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/preview/">Privacy
         Policy</a>.  UMass Lowell has no access to your Google account or the
        information you provide for it other than the account email address,
        which we may use to contact you.</p>

       <h4>Information about you</h4>

       <p>Beyond the name of your Google account, you do not have to tell us
        anything about yourself to download the App Inventor setup software or
        use the App Inventor Web site. Please understand
        that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you
        consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such
        Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with these Terms,
        and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these
        Terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable
        Information to us.</p>

       <p>We track information indicating, among other things, which pages of
        our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they
        were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls
        were used. We also track information about user projects and how those
        projects are developed when connected to Android devices.</p>

       <p>We may log the IP address, operating system and browser software
        used by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an
        IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic
        location of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analysis
        tools are used to collect this information. Some of the information is
        collected through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer). You
        should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web
        browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject
        cookies in the &quot;Help&quot; section of the toolbar.</p>

       <p>Among other things, we may use the
        information that you provide (including your Personally Identifiable
        Information) in connection with the following</p>

       <ul style="disc">
        <li>In order to debug and improve the App Inventor system.</li>
        <li>For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in
         the areas of how people learn and create with App Inventor.</li>
        <li>For the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal
         information, for example to respond to a specific inquiry or provide
         you the specific course and/or services you select.</li>
        <li>To publish information gathered about learning and creating with
         App Inventor but only as non-personally identifiable data.</li>
        <li>As otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Sharing with Third Parties</h4>

       <p>We may share the information we collect with third parties as
        follows:</p>
       <ul style="disc">
        <li>With service providers or contractors that perform certain
         functions on our behalf, including processing information that you
         provide to us on the Site or operating the Site or portions of
         it. These service providers and contractors will be obligated to keep
         your information confidential.</li>
        <li>With research collaborators, but only under the condition that they
         are obligated to keep any personally identifying information
         confidential.</li>
        <li>To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in
         response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another
         government agency, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
         illegal activities, suspected fraud, or to enforce our user agreement
         or privacy policy, or to protect our rights or the rights of
         others.</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>The Apps you create</h4>

       <p>By creating and storing apps on the App Inventor server you
        represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the apps,
        (i) that you have the authority to authorize UMass Lowell to store the apps on
        the UMass Lowell App Inventor Server and (ii) you will use the apps in
        compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not UMass Lowell,
        are solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.</p>

       <p>UMass Lowell has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with App
        Inventor. These apps belong to you. Your apps are stored on the UMass Lowell
        App Inventor server. You have the right to download your apps and
        delete them from the server at any time. If you delete an app, there
        is the possibility that UMass Lowell may be able to continue to access it, but such
        copies are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term
        preservation. UMass Lowell will strive to keep your apps and your account
        accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation
        to do so, and UMass Lowell has no liability for the consequences of the service
        becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable.  We therefore
        strongly suggest that you maintain backup copies of valuable apps at
        places besides the UMass Lowell App Inventor server. </p>

       <h4>User Postings</h4>

       <p>App Inventor has a gallery for sharing apps, user profile
        information and commentary. You agree that you are responsible for
        your own use of the Site and your User Postings. “User Postings”
        include all projects, applications and content submitted, posted,
        published or distributed on the Site by you or other users of the
        Site.</p>

       <p>By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you affirm,
        represent, and warrant that you are the creator and owner of or have
        the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to reproduce
        and publish the User Postings, and to authorize UMass Lowell and the Site&rsquo;s
        users to reproduce, modify, publish, and otherwise distribute your
        User Postings as necessary to exercise the license granted by you
        below. You, and not UMass Lowell, are solely responsible for your User Postings
        and the consequences of posting or publishing them.</p>

       <p>All content and projects on this Site are licensed under the
        Creative Commons Attribution- ShareAlike 4.0 International
        License. Therefore, by submitting any User Posting you hereby license
        it under the CC SA license, which permits anyone to view, modify, and
        redistribute these materials.</p>

       <p>UMass Lowell has no proprietary rights in your User Postings. You have the
        right to download or delete them from the server at any time.</p>
